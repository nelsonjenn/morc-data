First, a connected dirt vision is needed. We have incredible stand-alone trails in MSP but what is the plan for connecting these trail ""islands"" with dirt?""   I and friends/family spend money to ride Cuyuna, Duluth, Hayward, Bentonville, Kingdom Trails, etc.  Each has a different development model and has exploded in the past 10 years. MORC could lead the way in evolving a vision for a MSP DIRT network.
  
Second,   school-based trails are the future. We have an incredibly vibrant array of school-based club mtb programs in MSP.  MCA (Minnesota Cycling Association) parents (coaches) and athletes are highly engaged in the sport.  Parents ride, teachers ride, etc. Many district have plenty of land could be part of the overall MSP DIRT vision.  This trail vision doesn't need to be sprayed, mowed and manicured for the Friday night lights, it can be ridden and raced anytime by anyone.

Lastly, having been riding trails in the upper midwest since 1984, I am not the future of MSP DIRT..... but kids certainly are!  We purchased a home 8 years ago so my kids could  be closer, and ride to a dirt trail.  We're thankful for the ability to do that, but not everyone has this opportunity.  A connected system in MSP could enable any kid or family to access the outdoors and trails.  

Thanks for everything.  Happy to help out with the next phase.

They've been putting in new trail but places like WoD, Freight Train, Big Wheezy and Goat have major erosion issues that for a part of the summer were almost unrideable. Alongside that, I try to stay in tune to the Facebook page for BC as well as the local Mountain Bikers of Minnesota page and I don't believe they've had a single organized trail session that wasn't with a NICA group this year. I would've loved to help out due to the major issues we had this year but I felt like even though I wanted to, I wasn't able to - barring doing light maintenance (clearing branches, some small trees myself). Speaking of trees - there were major trail-impeding trees down for multiple weeks in some areas at BC, although most of the trees that were around blind corners were taken care of fairly fast. I love BC and I probably ride it more than most but it's been less and less fun over the last year or so, and I'm concerned that these issues will get worse as there becomes more trail to maintain.

I don't want to just criticize though - I really would help on dig nights if they held them next year!",7,Male,White,gage.read009@gmail.com (Gage Read)

Some of us just want to ride old school chonk with a bit of flow thrown in.  More importantly,  MORC needs to take the lead on trail etiquette education and signage at trails. Leb in particular has become so bro-culture that it drives newer riders and moms with kids away because it's not safe with all the Strava dudes running kids off the trails. When I cut my teeth riding out west in the 90s, we self-enforced and educated newer riders on IMBA rules and basic trail decency. We seem to have lost that. A few ideas: Signage at the trails emphasizing etiquette and setting forth the rules. Partner with MCA to require trail etiquette training (an actual class) and the signing of an etiquette agreement for all coaches, riders and PARENTS.",7,Female,White,Kathleen Ritter kathleen.ritter0215@gmail.com
