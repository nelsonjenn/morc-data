I\u2019d thought about beginning MTB other places I\u2019ve lived, but with the patchwork of trail orgs, spotty info, etc it never seemed worth making the initial investment.  Here I knew there were plenty of trails I could ride with readily available info, trail maps (with green; blue; black ratings) so I could find out where to go.  Made buying the bike worth it because I knew I had plenty of trails I could access.  It keeps the ball rolling with then News stories and more people start.",

We have incredible stand-alone trails in MSP but what is the plan for connecting these trail \"islands\" with dirt?\"   I and friends/family spend money to ride Cuyuna, Duluth, Hayward, Bentonville, Kingdom Trails, etc.  Each has a different development model and has exploded in the past 10 years. MORC could lead the way in evolving a vision for a MSP DIRT network.\n  \nSecond,   school-based trails are the future. We have an incredibly vibrant array of school-based club mtb programs in MSP.  MCA (Minnesota Cycling Association) parents (coaches) and athletes are highly engaged in the sport.  Parents ride, teachers ride, etc. Many district have plenty of land could be part of the overall MSP DIRT vision.  This trail vision doesn't need to be sprayed, mowed and manicured for the Friday night lights, it can be ridden and raced anytime by anyone.\n\nLastly, having been riding trails in the upper midwest since 1984, I am not the future of MSP DIRT..... but kids certainly are!  We purchased a home 8 years ago so my kids could  be closer, and ride to a dirt trail.  We're thankful for the ability to do that, but not everyone has this opportunity.  A connected system in MSP could enable any kid or family to access the outdoors and trails.  \n\nThanks for everything.  Happy to help out with the next phase. \n",

They've been putting in new trail but places like WoD, Freight Train, Big Wheezy and Goat have major erosion issues that for a part of the summer were almost unrideable. Alongside that, I try to stay in tune to the Facebook page for BC as well as the local Mountain Bikers of Minnesota page and I don't believe they've had a single organized trail session that wasn't with a NICA group this year. I would've loved to help out due to the major issues we had this year but I felt like even though I wanted to, I wasn't able to - barring doing light maintenance (clearing branches, some small trees myself). Speaking of trees - there were major trail-impeding trees down for multiple weeks in some areas at BC, although most of the trees that were around blind corners were taken care of fairly fast. I love BC and I probably ride it more than most but it's been less and less fun over the last year or so, and I'm concerned that these issues will get worse as there becomes more trail to maintain.\n\nI don't want to just criticize though - I really would help on dig nights if they held them next year!",

		"What do you think MORC needs to improve?": "I really enjoy the trails we have around here, but, TRAIL CLOSURES. Way too high and mighty closing the trails, and then whoever is in charge of reporting the trail won\u2019t provide an update for sometimes 4-5 days (Monarch for example last weekend, a BRAND NEW highly anticipated trail system and you can\u2019t even update it for us???). The smallest bit of rain will close the trails sometimes. Let people ride. It\u2019s not just kids and families riding these trails on the weekends, it\u2019s passionate, daily riders who aren\u2019t concerned about riding some muddy trails, or a big scary rut popping up. I stopped my membership/donations because I hate paying for it when other people get to decide when I can and cannot do the thing I love most in life, and again can\u2019t even take the time to ensure a backup plan or someone to help them update trail status daily.",
